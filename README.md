## Matrix-Library-Oh

**Task** :  Implement A small library in C++ using expression templates and Modern C++11/14/17 features.:

* represent a matrix of numerical types (int, long, float, double, complex,....)
* compute algebraic expressions including
elementwise addition, subtraction, scalar multiplication operations using the operators `+`, `-`, `+=`, `-=`, etc.
and the standard matrix multiplication using the most simple algorithm with an operator of your choice.
* fit in one header file
* provides a test program which measures the speed of execution for each examples provided

**Required Results**: final report (documentation); source code; a demo program using this library  
**Evaluation**: mid-term oral presentation; final presentation with final report  
**Time**: one month
